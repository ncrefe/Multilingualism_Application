The application allows users to learn languages through quizzes. Users choose a language (Turkish, German, Italian, or Spanish) and progress through randomly generated units (60-100) with quizzes (1-10) in each unit. Quizzes consist of questions (8-15) of different types: reading, listening, speaking, and word-matching. Points are awarded based on correct answers (reading: 10, listening: 7, speaking: 8, word-matching: 5). Users can advance through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Sapphire, and Ruby leagues based on points and streaks. The data is stored in "languages.csv" and user results are recorded in "users.csv".

Queries:

* User with the maximum points.
* User in the most advanced German unit.
* Language with the maximum number of units.
* Language with the maximum number of quizzes.
* Top three users in the Silver league for Italian.
